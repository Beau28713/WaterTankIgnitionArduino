# Arduino UNO REV 2 and Ignition Scada Communication over TCP


#### About
To enhance my understanding of the MODBUS communication protocol and Ignition SCADA Software, I sought practical experience. However, I did not have access to any PLCs and was unable to justify the expense of purchasing one. Fortunately, I had an Arduino UNO Wifi Rev 2 available. I was aware that Arduino could communicate using MODBUS via RS485 and/or MODBUS over TCP by leveraging the Arduino MODBUS library. By utilizing Ignition's free-for-personal-use Maker edition SCADA software and the Arduino, I embarked on a project to build and automate my home water system.
